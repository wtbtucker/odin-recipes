    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Bibimbap is a Korean rice dish typically consisting of rice, sauteed vegetables, gochujang, soy sauce, beef, and an egg. 
        Traditionally, all of the ingredients would be made independently and mixed at the end. 
        This weeknight variation uses the Instant Pot pot-in-pot method to cook all of the ingredients (minus the egg) together. 
        Serve this beef bowl with plenty of the gochujang-based sauce and optionally add a fried egg to really elevate the dish.

        <li>1 tablespoon Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Sesame Oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon White Vinegar</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons Water</li>
        <h4>Main Dish</h4>
        <li>1 pound Lean Ground Beef</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Sesame Oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Minced Garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>1 cup Jasmine Rice, rinsed</li>
        <li>1.25 cups Water, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <h4>Foil Packet Vegetables</h4>
        <li>1 cup bean sprouts</li>
        <li>3 cups spinach leaves</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded carrots</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the gochujang, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, vinegar, garlic, and water.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, stir together spinach leaves, sesame oil, and salt. Use your hands to roughly macerate the spinach. Toss in bean sprouts and carrots and mix gently. Place vegetables on a large sheet of aluminum foil, and fold the foil to enclose the vegetables. Close up the packet and set aside.</li>
        <li>Select SAUTÉ/Normal on the Instant Pot. When the pot is hot, add the ground beef and break up as much as you can. Add ¼ cup of water and deglaze thoroughly allowing the water to evaporate.</li>
        <li>Add in rice, soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic, and salt and stir well. Add mushrooms and water. Press CANCEL to turn the pot off.</li>
        <li>Place a steamer rack in the pot on top of the rice. Place the foil packet on the rack.</li>
        <li>Secure the lid on the pot. Close the pressure-release valve. Select MANUAL/PRESSURE COOK and set the pot at HIGH pressure for 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>When cook time is complete, let the pot release pressure naturally for 10 minutes. At the end of the cooking time, use a quick release to depressurize.</li>
        <li>Carefully remove and unpack the foil packet. Stir the contents of the packet into the rice, stirring gently.</li>
        <li>Serve the rice with the gochujang sauce.</li>
