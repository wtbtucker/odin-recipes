    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Create an easy and healthy meal on a weeknight using the Instant Pot. This recipe makes chicken thighs, sweet potatoes, and quinoa tied together by Morroco-inspired spices.  
        If the downtime during each of the three dishes is used efficiently this recipe can be made and cleaned up in under an hour. This dish is an excellent meal-prep option because it reheats well.
